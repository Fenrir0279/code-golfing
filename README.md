###### [Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/Fenrir0279/code-golfing/blob/main/collatz.py)
The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)</sup>

###### [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/Fenrir0279/code-golfing/blob/main/multiples_3_5.py)
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.<sup>[[2]](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)</sup>
