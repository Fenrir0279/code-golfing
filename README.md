# code-golfing
### [Code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) is a type of recreational computer programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the shortest possible source code that solves a certain problem

###### [Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/Fenrir0279/code-golfing/blob/main/collatz.py)
The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)</sup>

###### [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/Fenrir0279/code-golfing/blob/main/multiples_3_5.py)
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.<sup>[[2]](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)</sup>

###### [Even Fibonacci](https://github.com/Fenrir0279/code-golfing/blob/main/even_fib.py)
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.<sup>[[3]](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)</sup>

<span style="color: red">**Variation**</span>: Instead of having the first 4 million fibonacci values, find the sum of the first n fibonacci numbers, where n is the number of even fibonacci numbers under the user's input.

###### [Euler Question 6](https://github.com/Fenrir0279/code-golfing/blob/main/euler_6.py)
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

        1² + 2² + 3² + ... + 10² = 385
        
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

        (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is:

        3025 - 385 = 2640

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.<sup>[[4]](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)</sup>
